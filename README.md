Sarcasm Detection Using Emoji and Text Analysis
The dataset.xlsx file has the data stats and the data before and after preprocessing. 
I have taken the 12.9K input data (emoji + text) separately and put it in a csv file in the 'Data to work with' folder(zip). These are supposed to be the input files for word_to_vec and emoji_to_vec codes.
The coursework codes and report are in Project II Group 10 zip folder.
